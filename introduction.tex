\lettrine{\libertineInitialGlyph{T}}{he} space of knots is the disconnected space of embeddings of \(\S^{1}\) into \(\R^{3}\), in which the connected components, the ``rooms'', are the knot types. Vassiliev studied the space of knots by looking at its ``walls'' of a specific type: those immersions of \(\S^{1}\) into \(\R^{3}\) which fail to be embeddings by having a single point of trasverse intersection. The addition of these walls makes the space of objects we study a connected space. Any two knots are connected by a path that passes through finitely many of the walls. The space of walls is also disconnected, but it can be connected by allowing paths to pass through finitely many ``cornices'' where two walls meet. These are immersions that fail to be embeddings by having two points of transverse intersection. The cornices are again disconnected but can be connected by ``corners'' and so on, with any immersions with \(m\) double points being connected by a finite number of immersions with \(m + 1\). This produces the ``stratification'' of the space: a very schematic illustration is given below. Note that this picture doesn't properly capture the infinite-dimensional nature of the stratification. Nor some other missing details which will appear in Chapter \ref{ch:vassiliev-invariants-and-chord-diagrams}.

In \cite{cohomology-of-knot-spaces}, Vassiliev makes a sequence of approximations of the cohomology ring of the space of knots, yielding a certain subring of the zeroth cohomology ring. Elements of this are locally constant functions on the space, so knot invariants. This subring of ``Vassiliev'' knot invariants can be computed on any knot by some procedure involving the homology group of the strata at a finite number of increasing depths.

Birman and Lin in \cite{knot-polynomials-and-vassilievs-invariants} give an axiomatic definition of the Vassiliev invariants as those that respect the Vassiliev skein relation. It follows, as we will see in Chapter \ref{ch:vassiliev-invariants-and-chord-diagrams} that Vassiliev invariants can be described completely combinatorially by functions on chord diagrams obeying certain combinatorial rules.

By the work of Bar-Natan in \cite{on-the-vassiliev-knot-invariants} the algebra of chord diagrams turns out to be equivalent to a different diagrammatic algebra, that of Jacobi diagrams, again up to a different set of combinatorial rules. This will be discussed in Chapter \ref{ch:lie-theory-and-jacobi-diagrams}. This change of perspective introduces Lie theory in the following sense. A key relation in the algebra of Jacobi diagrams is a formal version of the relation in the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra that the bracket is equal to the commutator. This is discussed in Chapter \ref{ch:jacobi-diagrams-as-a-universal-enveloping-algebra}. A rigorous version of this statement is the work of Hinnich and Vaintrob \cite{cyclic-operads-and-the-algebra-of-chord-diagrams} which constructs the algebra of Jacobi diagrams as the universal enveloping algebra object of some Lie algebra object in some tensor category.

	A paragraph introducing welded knots: If knots have to do with the configuration space of some number of points, then welded knots have to do with the configuration space of some number of `flying rings'. Arrowed Jacobi diagrams will need to be introduced. Kashiwara-Vergne may need to be mentioned.

In Chapter \ref{ch:arrowed-jacobi-diagrams-as-a-universal-enveloping-algebra}, we generalise the result that Jacobi diagrams are a universal enveloping algebra to directed(/welded/arrowed) Jacobi diagrams.
