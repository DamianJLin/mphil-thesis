\begin{mdframed}
	Scaffold of chapter:

	-- That 4T looks like STU/IHX. Hint at Lie algebra relations.

	-- The isomorphism from Chord diagrams to Jacobi diagrams with proof.

	-- Bar-Natan construction: Lie algebra \(\to\) some weight systems. i.e. you get a quotient(?) of \(\mathcal{A}\) from this?

	-- Some examples of this, and some talking about diagrams not detected by Lie algebras (who?), even Lie Superalgebras (Vogel). Perhaps also some dimensions of spaces.

	-- Go through classical Hinnich-Vaintrob.
