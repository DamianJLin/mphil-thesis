\chapter{Vassiliev invariants and chord diagrams}
\label{ch:vassiliev-invariants-and-chord-diagrams}

\begin{shaded}
	Something to maybe include somewhere:

	The point of Vassiliev theory is to study the space of knots in the context of the singularities that lie between knots.

	In view of this point, we spend Section \ref{sec:singular-knots} looking at a the stratification of the space of knots. This leads to a beautiful (and fruitful) classical analogy which we will explored in Section \ref{sec:the-stratification-on-the-space-of-knots-and-integration} and throughout this chapter.

	In Section \ref{sec:knots-and-vassiliev-invariants}, with the context in mind, we introduce the main players in this theory.
\end{shaded}

\lettrine{\libertineInitialGlyph{P}}{olynomial} functions are a special type of function. They are related in a natural way to the derivative, they are defined by a finite amount of combinatorial data, and they can be used to approximate any continuous function.

In the same way, the Vassiliev knot invairants are a special type of knot invariant. And this analogy, first made by Dror Bar-Natan in \cite{on-the-vassiliev-knot-invariants} is by no means superficial. As we will come to see, Vassiliev invariants enjoy analogues of the first two properties above, and conjeturally also the third.

In this chapter we give a version of the introductory theory of Vassiliev invariants in which the analogy above is made as explicitly as possible. This also leads a natural interpretation of the defining relations of the algebra \(\mathcal{A}\) which is the fundamental object of study in the field.

\section{Singular knots}
\label{sec:singular-knots}

\begin{definition}
	A \textbf{singular knot} is an immersion of \(S^{1}\) into \(\R^{3}\) which fails to be an embedding at finitely many singularities, and where the singularities are all double-points of transverse intersection. When a singular knot has \(m\) such singularities, we call it \textbf{\(m\)-singular}.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
	\label{rem:other-singularities}
	Immersions with other types of singularities, are excluded from this definition, so the word ``singular'' in ``singular knot'' refers specifically to double point singularities. In particular immersions with
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item triple points
		\item points with vanishing derivative
	\end{enumerate}
	are excluded from the definition.
\end{remark}

A singular knot with one double point is very close to two other knots. In one, the double point is replaced by a positive crosing, and in the other a negative crossing.

Just as we have notions of ambient isotopy for knots, and knot invairants, we can have \(m\)-singular isotopy and \(m\)-singular knot invariants.

\begin{definition}
	\label{def:differentiable-invariant}
	An invariant \(f\) of \(m\)-singular knots is \textbf{differentiable} if
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:diff}
		\tag{\differentiability}
		f \left( \poscross \ \double \right) - f\left( \negcross \ \double \right) = f \left( \double \ \poscross \right) - f\left( \double \ \negcross \right).
	\end{equation}
\end{definition}

If an \(m\)-singular knot invariant is differentiable, we can extend it to an invariant of \((m + 1)\)-singular knots by a procedure analagous to taking its derivative.

\begin{definition}
	\label{def:derivative}
	The \textbf{derivative} \(\delta\) of a differentiable \(m\)-singular knot invariant \(f\) is an \((m + 1)\)-singular knot invariant
	\[\delta f \left( \double \right) = f \left( \poscross \right) - f\left( \negcross \right).\]
\end{definition}

A regular knot invariant (which is an invariant of \(0\)-singular knots) satisfies this condition vaccuously so is differentiable and its derivative is an invariant of \(1\)-singular knots. Furthermore, if an invariant of \(m\)-singular knots is differentiable, so is its derivative, so it can be extended to any number of double points. In-particular, regular knot invariants have derivatives of any order.

Rather than thinking about functions on knots satisfying certain relations, the modern view of this subject takes the philosophy of imposing relations on the objects directly.

\begin{definition}
	\label{def:differentiable-knot}
	Define \(\singularknots_{m}\) as the span of all \(m\)-singular knots, taken over \(\mathbb{Q}\), modulo the following boundary relation (also known as a codifferentiability relation):
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:codiff}
		\tag{\differentiabilitystar}
		\poscross \ \double - \negcross \ \double = \double \ \poscross - \double \ \negcross.
	\end{equation}
	From now on, we will refer to elements \(\singularknots_{m}\) as \(m\)\textbf{-singular knots}, i.e. the \ref{eq:codiff} relation will be implicitly assumed.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	\label{def:boundary}
	% FIX: Maybe better notation is d for derivarive and delta for boundary/codiff
	The \textbf{boundary} operation is the map \(\partial : \singularknots_{m} \to \singularknots_{m - 1}\) defined by
	\[ \double \longmapsto \poscross - \negcross .\]
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
	The derivative operation and the \ref{eq:diff} relation are dual to the boundary operation and the \ref{eq:codiff} relation. For example, a differentiable invariant of knots is the same as an invariant of knots in \(\singularknots_{m}\).
\end{remark}

Any knot invariant, \(f\) can be extended to an invariant \(f^{(m)}\) of \(m\)-singular knots by the Vassiliev skein relation 
\[f^{(0)} = f\]
and
\[f^{(m + 1)}\left(\double\right) = f^{(m)}\left(\poscross\right) - f^{(m)}\left(\negcross\right).\]
Often, we omit the superscript and write
\[f\left(\double\right) = f\left(\poscross\right) - f\left(\negcross\right).\]

The Vassiliev skein relation extends a knot via its derivative, or chooses a value on \((m + 1)\)-singular knots to agree with the difference of values on its boundary.

\begin{definitions}
	\label{def:vassiliev-invariant}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item A knot invariant \(V\) is a \textbf{Vassiliev invariant} of order (or type) \(m\) if when extended to singular knots via the Vassiliev skein relation,
		\[V\biggl( \underbrace{\double \cdots \double}_{{\scriptscriptstyle m + 1}} \biggr) = 0.\]
	\item The \textbf{order} of a Vassiliev invariant \(V\) is the highest \(m\) such that \(V\) is a Vassiliev invariant of order \(m\). (That is, the order of a Vassiliev invariant is the most double points a knot \(K\) can have without \(V(K)\) having to vanish).
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definitions}

\begin{remark}
	In other words, Vassiliev invariants of order \(m\) are those that vanish after \(m + 1\) derivatives, just like degree \(m\) polynomials.
\end{remark}

\section{The stratification of the space of knots and integration}
\label{sec:the-stratification-on-the-space-of-knots-and-integration}

To help see the bird's eye view we phrase the analogy between Vassiliev invariants and polynomials in terms of an integration theory, following \cite{integration-of-singular-braid-invariants}.

\begin{definition}
	An \textbf{integration theory} \((\mathcal{O}_{\star}, \partial_{\star})\) is a sequence
	% https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsNixbMSwwLCJcXG1hdGhjYWx7T31fe219Il0sWzAsMCwiXFxjZG90cyJdLFsyLDAsIlxcbWF0aGNhbHtPfV97bSAtIDF9Il0sWzMsMCwiXFxjZG90cyJdLFs0LDAsIlxcbWF0aGNhbHtPfV97MX0iXSxbNSwwLCJcXG1hdGhjYWx7T31fezB9Il0sWzEsMCwiXFxwYXJ0aWFsIl0sWzAsMiwiXFxwYXJ0aWFsIl0sWzIsMywiXFxwYXJ0aWFsIl0sWzMsNCwiXFxwYXJ0aWFsIl0sWzQsNSwiXFxwYXJ0aWFsIl1d
	\[\begin{tikzcd}
		\cdots & {\mathcal{O}_{m}} & {\mathcal{O}_{m - 1}} & \cdots & {\mathcal{O}_{1}} & {\mathcal{O}_{0}}
		\arrow["\partial", from=1-1, to=1-2]
		\arrow["\partial", from=1-2, to=1-3]
		\arrow["\partial", from=1-3, to=1-4]
		\arrow["\partial", from=1-4, to=1-5]
		\arrow["\partial", from=1-5, to=1-6]
	\end{tikzcd}\]
	of objects in some category, for example they could be vector spaces, algebras, free abelian groups, modules, etc. Here we call them spaces, because we wish to use the word object for elements of the spaces. In case we need to refer to a specific map, let \(\partial_{m}\) denote the map \(\partial\) whose domain is \(\mathcal{O}_{m}\). Note that we do not assume \(\partial^{2} = 0\).
\end{definition}

The space \(\mathcal{O}_{0}\) is the primary space we want to study. The spaces \(\mathcal{O}_{m}\) can often be thought of as containing \(m\)-singular objects of some kind. The map \(\partial\) takes an \(m\)-singular object \(x\) to some combination of \((m - 1)\)-singular objects near \(x\).

By fixing another space \(X\) and setting \(\mathcal{O}_{m}^{\ast} = \operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{O}_{m}, X)\), we get the sequence
% https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsNixbMSwwLCJcXG1hdGhjYWx7T31fe219XntcXGFzdH0iXSxbMCwwLCJcXGNkb3RzIl0sWzIsMCwiXFxtYXRoY2Fse099X3ttIC0gMX1ee1xcYXN0fSJdLFszLDAsIlxcY2RvdHMiXSxbNCwwLCJcXG1hdGhjYWx7T31fezF9XntcXGFzdH0iXSxbNSwwLCJcXG1hdGhjYWx7T31fezB9XntcXGFzdH0iXSxbMCwxLCJcXGRlbHRhIiwyXSxbMiwwLCJcXGRlbHRhIiwyXSxbMywyLCJcXGRlbHRhIiwyXSxbNCwzLCJcXGRlbHRhIiwyXSxbNSw0LCJcXGRlbHRhIiwyXV0=

where \(\delta_{m}\) is the transpose (adjoint) of \(\partial_{m}\). The maps \(\delta\) behave like derivatives: \(\delta(f)\) for \(f \in \mathcal{O}_{m}^{\ast}\) defines \(f\) on \(\mathcal{O}_{m + 1}^{\ast}\) as some combination of its values on ``close'' \(m\)-singular elements.

\begin{questions}
	\label{qu:integration-theory}
	We wish to understand how to invert this process, namely:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item When does a functional in \(\mathcal{O}^{\ast}_{m}\) ``integrate'' to a functional in \(\mathcal{O}^{\ast}_{m - 1}\)?
		\item Is the integral of a functional in \(\mathcal{O}_{m}^{\ast}\) uniquely defined, or are there choices to be made?
		\item When does such a functional integrate multiple times, in-particular when does it integrate \(m\) times into a functional in \(\mathcal{O}^{\ast}_{0}\), (i.e. a function on the non-singular objects)?
		\item If there are choices to be made in integration, do they affect whether the new functional is integrable again?
		\item Which functions on the non-singular objects \(\mathcal{O}_{0}\) are obtained by \(m\) consecutive integrations of functionals in \(\mathcal{O}_{m}^{\ast}\)?
	\end{enumerate}
\end{questions}
The answers to the above questions are given precisely by the following spaces1
\begin{definitions}
	\label{def:integration-theory-modules}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The \textbf{primary obstructions to integration} are the space
			\[P\mathcal{O}_{m} = \ker{\partial_{m}}.\]
		\item The \textbf{constants of integration} are the space
			\[C\mathcal{O}_{m} = \mathcal{O}_{m} / \partial \mathcal{O}_{m + 1}.\]
		\item The \textbf{secondary obstructions to integration} are the space
			\[S\mathcal{O}_{m} = \ker{(\partial_{m + 1}\partial_{m})} / P\mathcal{O}_{m},\]
			and likewise the \textbf{order \(k\) obstructions to integration} are defined analagously.
		\item The \textbf{weights of integration} are the space
			\[W\mathcal{O}_{m} = C\mathcal{O}_{m} / \pi(P\mathcal{O}_{m})\]
			where \(\pi: \mathcal{O}_{m} \to C\mathcal{O}_{m}\) is the projection.
		\item The \textbf{finite type invariants} of order \(m\) are the space
			\[FT\mathcal{O}_{m} = \ker \delta^{m + 1},\]
			where \(\delta^{m + 1}\) denotes \(m + 1\) applications of \(\delta\) with appropriate indices, ending with \(\delta_{m}\).

	\end{enumerate}
\end{definitions}
It may not be entirely obvious how these definitons provide answers to the questions above. In the rest of this section we will see the truth of this in the case \(\mathcal{O}_{\star} = \singularknots_{\star}\).

% TODO: [Zsuzsi]: If you're referencing a figure, have the figure number (eventually)
Recall from the picture from the introduction that \(m\)-singular knots are components of the stratification of the space of knots of codimension \(m\).
% TODO: Currently this is not in the introduction. Decide whether to introduce it here instead.

\begin{definition}
	A \textbf{singular isotopy}, \(\Psi(t)\) of \(m\)-singular knots is a path in the union of the \(m\)-th and \((m + 1)\)-st strata such that the path only intersects the \((m + 1)\)st stratum transversally and finitely many times. The intersections \(\{\Psi_{s} : 1 \leq s \leq r\}\) of the path with the \((m + 1)\)st stratum are called the \textbf{singularities} of the singular isotopy. The \textbf{signs} \(\varepsilon_{s} = \varepsilon(s): \{s\} \to \{\pm 1\}\) of the singularities give the signs of the corresponding intersection.
	% TODO: There is currently a notion of singular isotopy in the first paragraphs of this chapter. Perhaps say something like "We provide a proper definition in x.x.x"
\end{definition}

\begin{shaded}
	Figure: singular isotopy.
\end{shaded}

To rephrase the definitions in Section~\ref{sec:singular-knots}, in the integration theory \(\mathcal{O}_{\star} = \singularknots_{\star}\), 
differentiation constructs from an invariant \(Q\) of \(m\)-singular knots, an invariant \(Q'\) of \((m + 1)\)-singular knots such that along singular isotopies from \(k_{0}\) to \(k_{1}\),
\[Q(k_{0}) - Q(k_{1}) = \sum_{s = 1}^{r}\varepsilon_{s} Q'(\Psi_{s}).\]
Due to the boundary relation this is always well-defined.

Integration is to construct from an invariant \(P\) of \((m + 1)\)-singular knots an invariant \(Q\) of \(m\)-singular knot such that
\[Q(k_{0}) - Q(k_{1}) = \sum_{s = 1}^{r}\varepsilon_{s} P(\Psi_{s}),\]
in which case we write \(P = Q'\). This is like a ``path-integral'' along a singular isotopy. For this to be well-defined, \(P\) needs to be path-independent. Equivalently, all integrals along closed paths (where \(k_{0} = k_{1}\)) must vanish. In particular, recall from Remark \ref{rem:other-singularities} that for example, triple points are excluded from all levels of the stratification, leaving ``holes'' in the strata. The vanishing of integrals along singular isotopies around such holes give rise to the following relations, and satisfying these are necessary conditions for \(P\) to integrate:

\begin{definition}
	\label{def:topological-singular-relations}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item
			\label{subdef:T4Tstar}
			The following closed singular isotopy around a triple point:
			\begin{center}
				\def\svgwidth{0.6\columnwidth}
				\input{graphics/triple_point_singular_isotopy.pdf_tex}
			\end{center}
		gives rise to a \textbf{topological four-term relation}
			\begin{equation}
				\label{eq:T4Tstar}
				\tag{\topologicalfourtermstar}
				f\left( \tftsouth \right)
				-
				f\left( \tfteast \right)
				-
				f\left( \tftnorth \right)
				+
				f\left( \tftwest \right)
				= 0.
			\end{equation}
		\item
			\label{subdef:T1Tstar}
			The singular isotopy
			\begin{center}
				\def\svgwidth{0.6\columnwidth}
				\input{graphics/vanishing_derivative_singular_isotopy.pdf_tex}
			\end{center}
		around a point with a vanishing derivative gives rise to a \textbf{topological one-term relation}
			\begin{equation}
				\label{eq:T1Tstar}
				\tag{\topologicalonetermstar}
				f\left( \topologicalonecotermgraphic \right) = 0.
			\end{equation}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
	Note that for framed knots, only the singular isotopy in Definition~\ref{def:topological-singular-relations}~\ref{subdef:T4Tstar} is closed, whereas the singular isotopy Definition~\ref{def:topological-singular-relations}~\ref{subdef:T1Tstar} is not. So only \ref{eq:T4Tstar} holds. When considering unframed knots, the theory is the same as what we present below, but \ref{eq:T1Tstar} plays the same role as \ref{eq:T4Tstar}.

	In particular, for every statement in the rest of this chapter about weight systems, chord diagrams, etc. there is a corresponding theorem for the unframed weight systems, etc. in which for every hypothesis involving a \ref{eq:T4Tstar} (or variant thereof), a similar one involving \ref{eq:T1Tstar} (or variant thereof) must also hold.
\end{remark}

So, combinations of \(m\)-singular knots of the form
\[
	\tftsouth
	\ - \
	\tfteast
	\ - \
	\tftnorth
	\ + \
	\tftwest
\]
are in \(P\singularknots_{m} = \ker \partial_{m}\). Any nonvanishing functionals on them can't integrate. But do combinations of these forms span the primary obstructions? Are they the only possible reasons that that \(f\) doesn't integrate?

\begin{theorem}[Stanford \cite{finite-type-invariants-of-knots-links-and-graphs}]
	\label{thm:stanford-integrates-once}
	An invariant \(f\) of \(m\)-singular knots integrates to an invariant of \((m - 1)\)-singular knots if and only if it satisfies \textup{\ref{eq:T4Tstar}}.
\end{theorem}

For example, the corresponding unframed version of Stanford's theorem reads: \textit{An invariant \(f\) of \(m\)-singular unframed knots integrates to an invariant of \((m - 1)\)-singular unframed knots if and only if it satisfies \textup{\ref{eq:T4Tstar}} and \textup{\ref{eq:T1Tstar}}.}

\begin{proof}[sketch]
	% TODO: Fill out Stanford's integration homotopy proof
	% NOTE: [Zsuzsi] Be minful of clearly distinguishing between intuition and precise maths. If this proof only exists as a sketch in the literature, it can be a nice contribution to fill in the details, and if you do, you should say so.
	\begin{shaded}
		Let \(\gamma = \Psi(t)\) be a singular isotopy and let \(\Phi(\gamma)\) be the path integral along it. Construct a homotopy from \(\gamma\) to the constant singular isotopy in the stratification of knots with at least \(m - 1\) double points, and additional worse singularities. The only events to consider are codimension \(m + 2\) (why \(m + 2\)? is it to do with homotopy being "2"-dimensional?) events. They all change the \(\Phi(\gamma)\) by \(f(\tftterm)\) or \(f(\totterm)\) (or similar with \ref{eq:diff} relations, which we've said are implicit).

		Once the homotopy is complete, we are done as \(\Phi(\gamma_{\text{const}}) = 0\). On a down-to-earth level, why does this imply \(f\) can be integrated?
	\end{shaded}
\end{proof}

Continuing with Questions \ref{qu:integration-theory} and Definitions \ref{def:integration-theory-modules}, the constants of integration comprise the information that is lost when differentiating. In the case of knots, given an invariant \(f\) of \(m\)-singular knots, differentiating defines an invariant \(\delta f\) on \((m + 1)\)-singular knots as the difference of \(f\) on two ``neighbouring'' \(m\)-singular knots. This way, the individual value of \(f\) on either of these \(m\)-singular knots is lost, and when integrating, a choice has to be made.

Recall from Definition \ref{def:integration-theory-modules} (b) that \(C\singularknots_{m} = \singularknots_{m} / \partial \singularknots_{m + 1}\). What do the classes of this quotient look like? Well since
\[\partial \left( \double \right) = \poscross - \negcross,\]
the difference of an \(m\)-singular knot and the same \(m\)-singular knot with one crossing changed is the image of some \((m + 1)\)-singular knot under \(\partial\). Thus, the objects of this quotient are \(m\)-singular knots modulo crossing changes. So, the only data needed to describe them is the order in which the \(m\) double points are traversed around the \(m\)-singular knot.

\begin{definitions}
	\label{def:chord-diagram}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item A \textbf{chord diagram} of order \(m\) is an element of \(\singularknots_{m} / \partial \singularknots_{m + 1}\). An equivalent combinatorial description of such an element is an oriented circle with a distinguished set of \(m\) unordered pairs of points, considered up to orientation-preserving diffeomorphism of the circle. In figures, chords are drawn between each pair of points. The vector space spanned by chord diagrams of order \(m\) is denoted \(\mathcal{D}_{m}\), so \(\mathcal{D}_{m} = C\singularknots_{m}\). The oriented circle is called the \textbf{skeleton} of the chord diagram.
		\item The \textbf{chord diagram of an \(m\)-singular knot \(k\)}, denoted \(\sigma(k)\) is the chord diagram formed by the following process. Place \(2m\) points on the skeleton, two for each singular point of \(k\). Traversing both \(k\) and the circle, label the points on the skeleton in the order in which the singular points of \(k\) are traversed. Each label is given twice, pairing up the \(2m\) points, forming \(\sigma(k)\).
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definitions}

\begin{example}
	\[
		\includegraphics[width=0.14\textwidth, valign=c]{graphics/knot_9_33_singular.pdf}
		\quad \overset{\sigma}{\longmapsto} \quad
		\includegraphics[width=0.13\textwidth, valign=c]{graphics/chord_diagram_of_knot_9_33_singular.pdf}
	\]
\end{example}

\begin{proposition}
	Suppose \(P\) is an integrable \(m\)-singular invariant with integral \(Q\). Let \(Q_{0}\) differ from \(Q\) by a function on chord diagrams, that is
	\[Q_{0}(k) = Q(k) + q(\sigma(k))\]
	for \(q \in \mathcal{D}_{m}^{\ast}\)
	Then \(Q_{0}\) is also an integral of \(P\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	The derivative of an \(n\)-singular invariant that factors through \(\sigma\) is zero: crossing changes do not change the chord diagram, so when a crossing change occurs, the function does not change. Hence \(Q\) and \(Q_{0}\) have the same derivative: \(P\).
\end{proof}

Since we are trying to integrate more than once, we might wish to know which constants of integration are themselves integrable.

\begin{definition}
	\label{def:weight-system}
	A \textbf{weight system} is an integrable \(w \in \mathcal{D}_{m}^{\ast}\).
\end{definition}

The \ref{eq:T4Tstar} (and \ref{eq:T1Tstar} for unframed) relations are what knot invariants must satisfy to be integrable. If we take their images under \(\sigma\), we get the following relations in the space of chord diagrams.

\begin{definitions}
	\label{def:ft-ot-relations}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item A \textbf{four-term relation} is a relation of the kind
			\begin{equation}
				\label{eq:4Tstar}
				\tag{\fourtermstar}
				q\left(\ftsouth\right)
				- q\left(\fteast\right)
				- q\left(\ftnorth\right)
				+ q\left(\ftwest\right)
				= 0.
			\end{equation}

		\item A \textbf{one-term relation} (relevant in the unframed case) is a relation of the kind
			\begin{equation}
				\label{eq:1Tstar}
				\tag{\onetermstar}
				q\left( \isolatedchord \right) = 0.
			\end{equation}
			where the chord shown is \textbf{isolated}, meaning no other chord intersects it (when suitably isotoped).
	\end{enumerate}
	Just like \ref{eq:T4Tstar}, \ref{eq:4Tstar} is not an individual relation, but a class of relations. For example, there's one \ref{eq:4Tstar} relation for all ways of placing other chords on the dotted parts of the diagrams above, identically in all four diagrams.
\end{definitions}

\begin{proposition}
	A weight system is characterised as a constant of integration that satisfies \textup{\ref{eq:4Tstar}}.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	A weight system defines an \(m\)-singular invariant that is also invariant under crossing change. To integrate it must satisfy \ref{eq:4Tstar}. Since crossing changes are free, this is equivalent to satisfying the projection of \ref{eq:T4Tstar} into chord diagrams.
\end{proof}

We return now to the secondary (and higher) obstructions. A general integral of an \(m\)-singular \(P\) is only defined up to constants of integration, so is of the form
\[Q + q \circ \sigma.\]
Since integration is linear, for this to be integrable again, both terms need to be integrable. The latter we have just seen as the condition that \(q\) is a weight system. A sufficient condition for the former to be integrable is that the secondary obstructions \(S\singularknots_{m}\) vanish. But this is in terms of the general integration theory -- what does this mean concretely in this special case? It remains open but it's conjectured that the secondary obstructions always vanish.

\begin{conjecture}
	\label{conj:strong-fundamental-theorem}
	An invariant of \(m\)-singular knots satisfying \textup{\ref{eq:T4Tstar}} integrates \(m\) times into a genuine knot invariant.
\end{conjecture}

\begin{remarks}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item At first glance, this conjecture looks like it follows from Theorem~\ref{thm:stanford-integrates-once}. The point is that it may not be possible to choose the integral to again satisfy \(\ref{eq:T4Tstar}\), which is what \(S\singularknots\) measures.
		\item Computing \(S\singularknots_{m}\) is dual to computing \(\ker \partial_{m + 1} \partial_{m} / \ker \partial_{m}\) (we saw a similar thing with the primary obstructions). Computing \(\ker \partial^{2}\) is the hard part --- it's not too hard to find some elements, but whether they form a spanning set is open.
		\item This conjecture is proven in certain cases. It holds in the integration theory for braids \cite{integration-of-singular-braid-invariants}, and in a certain sense it's ``half''-proven for knots \cite{a-combinatorial-half-integration-from-weight-system-to-vassiliev-knot-invariant}.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{remarks}

The finite type invariants in \(\singularknots_{\star}\) are simply the Vassiliev invariants, as checked by a simple comparison between Definitions \ref{def:vassiliev-invariant} and \ref{def:integration-theory-modules}. In other words, Vassiliev invariants of order \(m\) are those which vanish on parts of the strata at and above some depth \(m + 1\).

If we restrict Conjecture \ref{conj:strong-fundamental-theorem} to Vassiliev invariants, then we get the following.

\begin{theorem}[Fundamental theorem of Vassiliev invariants]
	\label{thm:fundamental-theorem-of-vassiliev-invariants}
	Let \(v\) be an invariant of \(m\)-singular knots satsifying \textup{\ref{eq:T4Tstar}} and the additional condition that \(\delta v = 0\). Then \(v\) integrates \(m\) times into a genuine knot invariant (which is a Vassiliev invariant of order \(m\)).
\end{theorem}

There are various proofs of the fundamental theorem. They are listed in \cite{the-fundamental-theorem-of-vassiliev-invariants}, and each proof is accompanied by a series of moral objections.
In the words of Bar-Natan: ``Always the method is indirect and very complicated, and/or some a-priori unnatural choices have to be made''.

\begin{remark}
	We have the implication Conjecture \ref{conj:strong-fundamental-theorem} \(\implies\) Theorem \ref{thm:fundamental-theorem-of-vassiliev-invariants}, and this is actually realised in the theory of braids. It is mysterious that the fate of the slightly stronger conjecture which comes from taking the natural topological approach to the fundamental theorem still remains unknown, and that there are grievances to be had with all known proofs of the theorem.
\end{remark}

In Section \ref{sec:the-fundamental-theorem-of-vassiliev-invariants} we will prove an equivalent formulation of the fundamental theorem.

\section{Knots and Vassiliev invariants}
\label{sec:knots-and-vassiliev-invariants}

Speaking broadly, the aim of Vassiliev theory is to study the space of knots using information from the stratification of knots introduced in the first two sections. This is done via the space of chord diagrams, which can be considered its linearisation or projectivisation. But these spaces are not just vector spaces. There is some further structure which we wish to incorporate.

\begin{definitions}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item The \textbf{space of knots}, denoted \(\mathcal{K}\), is the vector space spanned, over~\(\mathbb{Q}\), by non-singular knots. Equivalently, \(\mathcal{K} = \singularknots_{0}\).
		\item The space of knots is equipped with the \textbf{singular knot filtration}
			\[\mathcal{K} = \mathcal{K}_{0} \supset \mathcal{K}_{1} \supset \mathcal{K}_{2} \supset \cdots\]
			where the \(i\)th filtered component \(\mathcal{K}_{i}\) is the span of resolutions of singular knots with \(i\) double points, equivalently the image of \(\partial^{i}\), that is, \(\mathcal{K}_{i} = \partial^{i}(\singularknots_{i})\).
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definitions}

\begin{proposition}
	The singular knot filtration is indeed a descending filtration of vector spaces.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	This being a filtration of vector spaces, the only thing to check is that if \(i < j\), then \(\mathcal{K}_{i} \supset \mathcal{K}_{j}\). If \(k \in \mathcal{K}_{j}\), then \(k = \partial^{j}(k^{\bullet})\) for some \(k^{\bullet}\) in \(\mathcal{K}_{j}\). But then \(k = \partial^{j}(k^{\bullet}) = \partial^{i}\partial^{j - i}(k^{\bullet})\), so \(k \in \partial^{i}(\singularknots_{i})\).
\end{proof}

The algebraic structure on knots comes from the following operation.

\begin{definition}
	\label{def:connected-sum}
	The \textbf{connected sum} of two knots \(k_{1}\) and \(k_{2}\) is the knot obtained by removing a small arc from each of \(k_{1}\) and \(k_{2}\), then connecting the two embedded intervals into a single knot in an orientation-preserving way.
	\[
		\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth, valign=c]{graphics/connected_sum_example_before.pdf}
		\quad
		\overset{\connect}{\longmapsto}
		\quad
		\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth, valign=c]{graphics/connected_sum_example_after.pdf}
	\]
	This definition is extended bilinearly to \(\mathcal{K}\), i.e., to linear combinations of knots.
\end{definition}

The connected sum of knots is not a-priori well-defined, as we have not specified where along either \(k_{1}\) or \(k_{2}\) the small arc is to be removed or along which path they should be connected. However, by a classical knot-theoretic argument, the result is independent of either choice.

\begin{proposition}
	\label{prop:connected-sum-well-defined}
	The connected sum \(\connect : \mathcal{K} \otimes \mathcal{K} \to \mathcal{K}\) operations is well-defined: up to ambient isotopy, it does not matter where and along what path the connection was performed.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	We exhibit an ambient isotopy starting at \(k_{1} \connect k_{2}\) where the small arc is removed from \(k_{1}\) as in the example above. The part of the connected sum coming from \(k_{2}\) is shrunk by ambient isotopy. Since it can be shrunk arbitrarily small, let it be shrunk to lie within a small tubular neighbourhood of \(k_{1}\).
	\[
		\includegraphics[height=0.15\textwidth, valign=c]{graphics/connected_sum_isotopy_frame_1.pdf}
		\rightsquigarrow
		\includegraphics[height=0.15\textwidth, valign=c]{graphics/connected_sum_isotopy_frame_2.pdf}
	\]
	Then, \(k_{2}\) is then isotoped along \(k_{1}\), reenlarged and isotoped back to its original position.
	\[
		\includegraphics[height=0.15\textwidth, valign=c]{graphics/connected_sum_isotopy_frame_2.pdf}
		\rightsquigarrow
		\includegraphics[height=0.15\textwidth, valign=c]{graphics/connected_sum_isotopy_frame_3.pdf}
		\rightsquigarrow
		\includegraphics[height=0.15\textwidth, valign=c]{graphics/connected_sum_isotopy_frame_4.pdf}
	\]
	The above argument works for any choice of small arc removed along \(k_{1}\), and the same argument with the roles of \(k_{1}\) and \(k_{2}\) reversed completes the proof.

	A similar agument also shows that the path along which the two knots are connected doesn't matter, as \(k_{2}\) can always be shrunk to within a small tubular neighbourhood of \(k_{1}\).
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
	The connected sum respects the descending filtration:
	\[K_{i} \connect K_{j} \subset K_{i + j}.\]
	That is, the connected sum makes \((\mathcal{K}, \connect)\) into a descending filtered algebra.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	Indeed, the connected sum being a well-defined operation makes \(\mathcal{K}\) into an algebra. The question is whether the connected sum respects the filtration.

	If \(k \otimes \ell \in \mathcal{K}_{i} \otimes \mathcal{K}_{j}\), then there are \(k^{\bullet}\) and \(\ell^{\bullet}\) in \(\singularknots_{i}\) and \(\singularknots_{j}\) that resolve to \(k\) and \(\ell\), respectively. Similarly, the `connected sum' \(k^{\bullet} \connect \ell^{\bullet}\) resolves by \(\partial^{i + j}\) to \(k \connect \ell\), which is therefore in \(\partial^{i + j}(\mathcal{K}_{i + j})\).

	Here, `connected sum' is enclosed in inverted commas due to the following technicality. Connected sums of singular knots with singular knots were not part of Definition \ref{def:connected-sum}. Even if we ensure that the small arcs removed from a singular knot do not contain a singular point, still, this is ill-defined. The ambiguity is that the resulting singular knot may depend on from which side of the singular point the arc was removed i.e. the repositioning argument in the proof of Proposition \ref{prop:connected-sum-well-defined} fails due to the presence of singular points. After taking the resolution under \(\partial^{i + j}\) however, the repositioning argument now works again, so any of the choices of connected sum in \(k^{\bullet} \connect \ell^{\bullet}\) produce a singular knot which resolves to \(k \connect \ell\).
\end{proof}

% NOTE: In my mind, this is next definition is missing motivation. Proper motivation woould probably make reference to Lie (semi)group exponential map-logarithm stuff.
% i.e. Why is this the good definition to make if we want to study knots via chord diagrams.

\begin{definition}
	The coproduct \(\Delta: \mathcal{K} \to \mathcal{K} \otimes \mathcal{K}\) is defined on knots \(k\) as
	\[\Delta(k) = k \otimes k\]
	and extended bilinearly to \(\mathcal{K}\).
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    The triple \((\mathcal{K}, \connect, \Delta)\) forms a bialgebra. In other words, the connected sum and coproduct are compatible.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	A bialgeba is a vector space which is both a coalgebra and an algebra algebra with compatible product and coproduct.
	That \((\mathcal{K}, \Delta)\) forms a coalgebra is trivial (the counit is the augmentation map denoted \(\varepsilon\)). And we have already seen that \((\mathcal{K}, \connect)\) is an algebra. So it remains only to check the compatibility conditions. We check that the product and coproduct are compatible:
	\begin{align*}
		\Delta(k \connect \ell)
		& = k \connect \ell \otimes k \connect \ell \\
		& = (k \otimes k) \connect^{\otimes 2} (\ell \otimes \ell) \\
		& = \Delta(k) \connect^{\otimes 2} \Delta(\ell)
	\end{align*}
	where \(\connect^{\otimes 2}\) denotes the component-wise tensor product on \(\mathcal{K} \otimes \mathcal{K}\).
	
	Checking the unit and counit is trivial.
\end{proof}

So far, \(\mathcal{K}\) is a bialgebra whose product respects the filtration. The same is true of the coproduct.

\begin{proposition}
	\label{prop:singular-knots-filtered-bialgebra}
	The coproduct \(\Delta\) also respects the filtration,
	\[\Delta(\mathcal{K}_{j}) \subset \sum_{i = 0}^{j} \mathcal{K}_{i} \otimes \mathcal{K}_{j - i}.\]
	That is, with the singular knot filtration, \(\mathcal{K}\) is a filtered bialgebra.
\end{proposition}

We give a proof, due to Willerton which follows directly from Lemma of \ref{lem:co-leibniz-formula-for-knots} of \cite{vassiliev-invariants-and-the-hopf-algebra-of-chord-diagrams}. The lemma is a formula for the coproduct of an element of \(k \in \mathcal{K}_{m}\) that comes from some \(k^{\bullet} \in \singularknots_{m}\). The formula is terms of the \(2^{m}\) ways of resolving some of singular points in one cofactor and the rest in the other, but first we need some notation.

If \(I\) is a subset of the singular points of a singular knot, let \(\partial^{I}\) be the operator that resolves the singular points \(I\). Let \(\mu^{I}\) be the operator that averages singular points in \(I\), where averaging a singular point is sending
\[ \double \longmapsto \frac{1}{2} \left( \poscross + \negcross \right).\]

\begin{remark}
	There is one technicality. The operations \(\delta\) and \(\partial\) were defined without the need to specify a specific double point (this was the point of the \ref{eq:diff} and \ref{eq:codiff} relations). But the definitions of \(\mu^{I}\) and \(\partial^{I}\) are specific about double points. So for this Lemma \ref{lem:co-leibniz-formula-for-knots}, its proof and the proof of Proposition \ref{prop:singular-knots-filtered-bialgebra}, we write \(\mathcal{K}_{m}^{\bullet}\) even though we mean the lift of the \(\mathcal{K}_{m}^{\bullet}\)'s, without the \ref{eq:diff} and \ref{eq:codiff} relations. We choose not to alter the notation as projecting the formulas back down to the quotient properly proves that \(\Delta\) respects the filtration, as intended.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}[Willerton]
	\label{lem:co-leibniz-formula-for-knots}
	Suppose \(k^{\bullet} \in \mathcal{K}^{\bullet}_{m}\), and let \(S\) denote the set of singular points of \(k^{\bullet}\).
	\[
		\Delta(\partial^{S}(k^{\bullet}))
		=
		\sum_{I \subset S} \mu^{\bar{I}}\partial^{I}(k^{\bullet})
		\otimes
		\mu^{I}\partial^{\bar{I}}(k^{\bullet})
	\]
	where \(\bar{I} = S \smallsetminus I\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	We proceed by induction on \(m\). In the base case of \(m = 0\), \(S = \emptyset\), and \(k^{\bullet} = k\) is a genuine knot, so
	\begin{align*}
		\Delta(\partial^{0}(k))
		& = \Delta(k) \\
		& = k \otimes k \\
		& = \sum_{I \subset \emptyset}
			\mu^{\bar{I}}\partial^{I}(k)
			\otimes
			\mu^{I}\partial^{\bar{I}}(k). \\
	\end{align*}

	The inductive step is as follows. Let \(k^{\bullet} \in \singularknots_{m + 1}\). Let \(J\) denote all singular points of \(k^{\bullet}\), and \(x \in J\) denote a specific singular point. Furthermore, let \(k^{\bullet +}\) (resp. \(k^{\bullet - }\)) denote the \(m\)-singular knots obtained from \(k^{\bullet}\) when \(x\) is replaced by a positive (resp. negative) crossing, so that \(\partial^{\{x\}}(k^{\bullet}) = k^{\bullet +} - k^{\bullet -}\). We examine
	\[
		\sum_{\mathclap{I \subset J}}
			\mu^{\bar{I}}\partial^{I}(k^{\bullet})
			\otimes
			\mu^{I}\partial^{\bar{I}}(k^{\bullet}).
	\]
	Decomposing the sum based on whether \(x \in I\) yields
	\[
		\sum_{\mathclap{x \in I \subset J}}
			\mu^{\bar{I}}\partial^{I \smallsetminus \{x\}}(k^{\bullet})
			\otimes
			\mu^{I \smallsetminus \{x\}}\partial^{\bar{I}}(k^{\bullet})
			+
			\sum_{\mathclap{x \notin I \subset J}}
			\mu^{\bar{I} \smallsetminus \{x\}}\partial^{I}(k^{\bullet})
			\otimes
			\mu^{I}\partial^{\bar{I} \smallsetminus \{x\}}(k^{\bullet}),
	\]
	then resolving either \(\partial\) or \(\mu\) on \(x\),
	\begin{align*}
		& \frac{1}{2} \sum_{\mathclap{x \in I \subset J}}
		\mu^{\bar{I}}\partial^{I \smallsetminus \{x\}}(k^{\bullet +} - k^{\bullet -})
		\otimes
		\mu^{I \smallsetminus \{x\}}\partial^{\bar{I}}(k^{\bullet +} + k^{\bullet -}) \\
		+
		& \frac{1}{2} \sum_{\mathclap{x \notin I \subset J}}
		\mu^{\bar{I} \smallsetminus \{x\}}\partial^{I}(k^{\bullet +} + k^{\bullet -})
		\otimes
		\mu^{I}\partial^{\bar{I} \smallsetminus \{x\}}(k^{\bullet +} - k^{\bullet -}).
	\end{align*}
	Expanding, yields the cumbersome formula
	\begin{align*}
		& \frac{1}{2} \sum_{\mathclap{x \in I \subset J}}
			\Big(
				\mu^{\bar{I}}\partial^{I \smallsetminus \{x\}}(k^{\bullet +})
				\otimes
				\mu^{I \smallsetminus \{x\}}\partial^{\bar{I}}(k^{\bullet +})
				+
				\mu^{\bar{I}}\partial^{I \smallsetminus \{x\}}(k^{\bullet +})
				\otimes
				\mu^{I \smallsetminus \{x\}}\partial^{\bar{I}}(k^{\bullet -}) \\
				& \qquad \qquad \quad -
				\mu^{\bar{I}}\partial^{I \smallsetminus \{x\}}(k^{\bullet -})
				\otimes
				\mu^{I \smallsetminus \{x\}}\partial^{\bar{I}}(k^{\bullet +})
				-
				\mu^{\bar{I}}\partial^{I \smallsetminus \{x\}}(k^{\bullet -})
				\otimes
				\mu^{I \smallsetminus \{x\}}\partial^{\bar{I}}(k^{\bullet -})
			\Big) \\
		+
		& \frac{1}{2} \sum_{\mathclap{x \notin I \subset J}}
			\Big(
				\mu^{\bar{I} \smallsetminus \{x\}}\partial^{I}(k^{\bullet +})
				\otimes
				\mu^{I}\partial^{\bar{I} \smallsetminus \{x\}}(k^{\bullet +})
				-
				\mu^{\bar{I} \smallsetminus \{x\}}\partial^{I}(k^{\bullet +})
				\otimes
				\mu^{I}\partial^{\bar{I} \smallsetminus \{x\}}(k^{\bullet -}) \\
				& \qquad \qquad \quad +
				\mu^{\bar{I} \smallsetminus \{x\}}\partial^{I}(k^{\bullet -})
				\otimes
				\mu^{I}\partial^{\bar{I} \smallsetminus \{x\}}(k^{\bullet +})
				-
				\mu^{\bar{I} \smallsetminus \{x\}}\partial^{I}(k^{\bullet -})
				\otimes
				\mu^{I}\partial^{\bar{I} \smallsetminus \{x\}}(k^{\bullet -})
			\Big).
	\end{align*}
	Since \(\{I \mid I \subset J, x \notin I\}\) is equal to \(\{I \smallsetminus \{x\} \mid I \subset J, x \in I\}\), in each of the above sums, the corresponding terms have the same indices. Hence, the first and last terms in each sum combine, and the second and third terms cancel out to give
	\[
		\sum_{\mathclap{x \in I \subset J}}
			\mu^{\bar{I}}\partial^{I \smallsetminus \{x\}}(k^{\bullet +})
			\otimes
			\mu^{I \smallsetminus \{x\}}\partial^{\bar{I}}(k^{\bullet +})
		-
			\mu^{\bar{I}}\partial^{I \smallsetminus \{x\}}(k^{\bullet -})
			\otimes
			\mu^{I \smallsetminus \{x\}}\partial^{\bar{I}}(k^{\bullet -}).
	\]
	Since neither \(\mu^{\bar{I}}\partial^{I \smallsetminus \{x\}}\) or \(\mu^{I \smallsetminus \{x\}}\partial^{\bar{I}}\) are with respect to \(x\), this can be written
	\[
		\sum_{\mathclap{I \subset J \smallsetminus \{x\}}}
			\mu^{\bar{I}}\partial^{I}(k^{\bullet +})
			\otimes
			\mu^{I}\partial^{\bar{I}}(k^{\bullet +})
		-
			\mu^{\bar{I}}\partial^{I}(k^{\bullet -})
			\otimes
			\mu^{I}\partial^{\bar{I}}(k^{\bullet -})
	\]
	which by the inductive hypothesis is
	\begin{align*}
		\Delta(\partial^{J \smallsetminus \{x\}}(k^{\bullet +})) - \Delta(\partial^{J \smallsetminus \{x\}}(k^{\bullet -}))
		& = \Delta(\partial^{J \smallsetminus \{x\}}(k^{\bullet +}) - \partial^{J \smallsetminus \{x\}}(k^{\bullet -})) \\
		& = \Delta(\partial^{J}(k^{\bullet})).
	\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{proofof}{Proposition \ref{prop:singular-knots-filtered-bialgebra}}
	The operators \(\partial^{I}\) and \(\mu^{\bar{I}}\) commute since they are evaluating different singular points. Let \(I\) be an arbitrary subset of \(S\), and let \(|I| = i\) and \(|S| = j\), then the left cofactor is in \(\mathcal{K}_{i}\) and the right in \(\mathcal{K}_{j - i}\).
\end{proofof}

Not all knot invariants respect the singular knot filtration, as we will see. The point of the Vassiliev invariants is that they're the ones that are natural to consider with respect to the singular knot filtration. Indeed, the Vassiliev invariants are obtained directly from \(\mathcal{K}\) via the following construction.

A decreasing filtration on a bialgebra induces an ascending filtration on its dual bialgebra. The dual bialgebra's \(m\)th filtered component is the space of functionals on the original bialgebra that vanish on the \((m + 1)\)st filtered component. In the case of \(\mathcal{K}\), this is the set of knot invriants that vanish on \(\mathcal{K}_{m + 1}\): exactly the Vassiliev invariants of order \(m\). The product/coproduct in the dual bialgebra are those operations adjoint to the coproduct/product in the original bialgebra. The construction is standard and the details can be found in \cite[Appendix A.2.4]{introduction-to-vassiliev-invariants}.

\begin{definition}
	The \textbf{filtered bialgebra of Vassiliev invariants}, denoted \(\mathcal{V}\), is the vector space of Vassiliev invariants with an ascending filtration by degree
	\[\mathcal{V}_{0} \subset \mathcal{V}_{1} \subset \mathcal{V}_{2} \subset \cdots, \qquad \mathcal{V} = \bigcup_{m = 0}^{\infty} \mathcal{V}_{m}.\]
	The product is given by pointwise multiplication
	\[V_{1} \cdot V_{2}(k) = V_{1}(k)V_{2}(k),\]
	and the coproduct, \(\eta\), is given by
	\[\eta(V)(k_{1} \otimes k_{2}) = V(k_{1} \connect k_{2}).\]
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
	\label{prop:vassiliev-invariants-dual-to-singular-knots}
	The filtered bialgebraic dual of the descending filtered bialgebra of singular knots \(\mathcal{K}\) is the ascending filtered bialgebra of Vassiliev invariants \(\mathcal{V}\).
\end{proposition}

We don't prove this textbook fact, but let us sketch the main points. Indeed, by definition the set of functionals in \(\mathcal{K}^{\ast}\) that vanish on \(\mathcal{K}_{m + 1}\) is \(\mathcal{V}_{m}\).

Pulling \(V_{1} \otimes V_{2}\) back along \(\Delta\) gives,
\[(V_{1} \otimes V_{2}) \circ \Delta: k \mapsto V_{1}(k)V_{2}(k),\]
which recovers the formula for the product \(V_{1} \cdot V_{2}\) in \(\mathcal{V}\). Similarly, pulling \(V\) back along \(\connect\) yields
\[V \circ \connect (k_{1} \otimes k_{2}) \mapsto V(k_{1} \connect k_{2})\]
which recovers the formula for the coproduct, \(\eta\).

Here we rely on the fact that \(\mathcal{K}\) is of finite type (finite-dimensional in each filtered component).

\begin{remark}
	Alternatively, this can be proved directly in \(\mathcal{V}\). Proving that \(\connect\) respects the filtration on \(\mathcal{K}\) was easy, and is just as easy in the dual case. However, the proof that \(\Delta\) respects the filtration on \(\mathcal{K}\) was cumbersome, and so is its dual. But it is worth looking into how it can be understood by a continuation of the polynomial analogy due to Willerton \cite{vassiliev-invariants-and-the-hopf-algebra-of-chord-diagrams}.

	The generalised Leibniz theorem of multivariable calculus says that if \(f\) and \(g: \mathbb{R}^{m} \to \mathbb{R}\) are differentiable, then (in similar derivative notation to as above)
	\[
		\frac{\partial^{|I|}(fg)}{\partial_{x_{I}}}
		=
		\sum_{J \subset \{1, \cdots, i\}}
		\frac{\partial^{|J|} f}{\partial_{x_{J}}}
		\cdot
		\frac{\partial^{|\bar{J}|} g}{\partial_{x_{\bar{J}}}}.
	\]

	This says that the derivative of a product of \(f\) and \(g\) with respect to some variables is the sum of every way of taking some of those derivatives with respect to \(f\) and some with respect to \(g\).

	A kind of dual theorem follows from this. Let \(c \in \mathbb{R}\), and suppose that \(c\) comes from some pair of functions \(f\) and \(g: \mathbb{R}^{m} \to \mathbb{R}\) by taking their derivatives with respect to some of the variables and evaluating all remaining variables in the result. Then, we get a cofactorisation for \(c\) in \(\mathbb{R} \otimes \mathbb{R}\): i.e. if
	\[c = \left. \frac{\partial^{|I|}(fg)}{\partial_{x_{I}}} \right|_{\{x_{I} = a_{I}\}}\]
	then
	\[
		\mu
		\left(
		\sum_{J \subset \{1, \cdots, i\}}
		\left. \frac{\partial^{|J|} f}{\partial_{x_{J}}} \right|_{\{x_{J} = a_{\bar{J}}\}}
		\otimes
		\left. \frac{\partial^{|\bar{J}|} g}{\partial_{x_{\bar{J}}}} \right|_{\{x_{J} = a_{J}\}}
		\right)
		=
		c,
	\]
	where \(\mu: \mathbb{R} \otimes \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) is multiplication.

	As it turns out, this generalised ``co-Leibniz theorem'' is pretty useless in the multivariable calculus case. The filtration on \(\mathbb{R}\) coming from being the derivative of some function evaluated at some point is trivial, and so every \(c \in \mathbb{R}\) comes from some such \(f\) and \(g\), and it's easy to construct such \(f\) and \(g\). But the co-Leibniz theorem in the case of knots is exactly Willerton's Lemma \ref{lem:co-leibniz-formula-for-knots}, where the averaging map plays the role of evaluation. Recall that this was used to show that the coproduct respects the filtration.

	Furthermore, the knot version of the generealised Leibniz theorem \cite{vassiliev-invariants-and-the-hopf-algebra-of-chord-diagrams} is that if \(k^{\bullet} \in \singularknots_{m}\) and \(S\) the set of singular points of \(k^{\bullet}\), then
	\[
		(V_{1} \cdot V_{2})(\partial^{S}(k^{\bullet}))
		=
		\sum_{I \subset S}
		V_{1}(\mu^{\bar{I}}\partial^{I}(k^{\bullet}))
		\otimes
		V_{2}(\mu^{I}\partial^{\bar{I}}(k^{\bullet})).
	\]
	It follows directly from this that the product of two Vassiliev invariants respects the filtration: if \(V_{1}\) is of type \(m\) and \(V_{2}\) of type \(n\), then \(V_{1} \cdot V_{2}\) is of type \(m + n\): for if \(k^{\bullet} \in \singularknots_{m + n + 1}\), then either \(|I| > m\) or \(|\bar{I}| > n\), so in each summand, one of the cofactors is a Vassiliev invariant being evaluated above its order, so zero. Hence \((V_{1} \cdot V_{2})(\partial^{S}(k^{\bullet})) = 0\).

	How is this argument in analogy with some property of polynomials? Translating it from the knot-theoreic setting back into the original setting of multivariable calculus, it becomes a proof that polynomials are filtered by degree. So, in summary the cumbersome proof that \(\Delta\) respects the filtration on \(\mathcal{K}\) is a dual-version in a knot-theoretic setting of the fact that polynomials are filtered by degree.

\section{Chord diagrams and weight systems}
\label{chord-diagrams-and-weight-systems}

% TODO: See CDM Proposition A.24 and the associated exercise; check that this doesn't imply something extra needs to be included somewhere.

This bialgebra strucutre on knots is closely related to a similar bialgebra structure on chord diagrams. Knots are complicated and chord diagrams are much simpler, and the general idea is to study the former via the latter.

In Section \ref{sec:the-stratification-on-the-space-of-knots-and-integration} we saw how functions on chord diagrams specify Vassiliev invariants, so long as the functions satisfy \(\ref{eq:4Tstar}\) (and unframed Vassiliev invariants if they further satisfy \(\ref{eq:1Tstar}\)). We can instead encode this directly into the algebra of chord diagrams by the following relations.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:4T}
	\tag{\fourterm}
	\ftsouth
	\ - \ 
	\fteast
	\ -\ 
	\ftnorth
	\ + \ 
	\ftwest
	\ = \ 0.
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:1T}
	\tag{\oneterm}
	\isolatedchord \ = \ 0
\end{equation}

\begin{definition}
	We define \(\mathcal{A}_{m}\), the \textbf{space of chord diagrams} of degree \(m\) as
	\[\mathcal{A}_{m} = \mathcal{D}_{m} / \textup{\ref{eq:4T}}\]
	and \(\mathcal{A}\), the \textbf{space of chord diagrams} as
	\[\mathcal{A} = \bigoplus_{m = 0}^{\infty} \mathcal{A}_{m}.\]
	(The \textbf{space of unframed chord diagrams}, \(\mathcal{A}'\) is defined similarly from \(\mathcal{A}_{m}' = \mathcal{D}_{m} / \textup{\ref{eq:4T}}, \textup{\ref{eq:1T}}\).)
\end{definition}

\begin{warning}
	Both elements of \(\mathcal{A}\) and \(\mathcal{D}\) are known as chord diagrams. From now on when we say ``a chord diagram'', we mean an element of \(\mathcal{A}\) unless otherwise specified.
\end{warning}

The algebra \(\mathcal{A}\) has multiplication and coproduct operations that mirror those in \(\mathcal{K}\).

\begin{definition}
	The \textbf{connected sum of two chord diagrams} \(A_{1}\) and \(A_{2}\) is the chord diagram obtained by cutting the two circles of \(A_{1}\) and \(A_{2}\) and connecting the two intervals in an orientation-preserving way.
	\[
		\includegraphics[width=0.13\textwidth, valign=c]{graphics/chord_diagram_connected_sum_1.pdf}
		\quad
		\includegraphics[width=0.13\textwidth, valign=c]{graphics/chord_diagram_connected_sum_2.pdf}

		\overset{\connect}{\longmapsto}
		\quad
		\includegraphics[width=0.26\textwidth, valign=c]{graphics/chord_diagram_connected_sum_result.pdf}
		=
		\includegraphics[width=0.13\textwidth, valign=c]{graphics/chord_diagram_connected_sum_result_circular.pdf}
	\]
	The definition is extended bilinearly to elements of \(\mathcal{A}\).
\end{definition}

Again, this is not, a-priori, a well-defined operation, as the location of the cut on each circle was not specified. Indeed in the algebra \(\mathcal{D}\) this is ill-defined. However the \ref{eq:4T} relation in \(\mathcal{A}\) takes care of this.

\begin{proposition}
	The connected sum operation \(\connect : \mathcal{A} \otimes \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{A}\) is well-defined.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	We will prove that the connected sums of two chord diagrams, given any two choices of connection locations, are equal modulo \ref{eq:4T}.

	Let us denote the first chord diagram as \(a_{1}\) and the second as \(a_{2}\). Without loss of generality, it suffices to prove that without change in the connection location of \(a_{1}\), we can change the connection location on \(a_{2}\). Indeed it suffices to prove that we can rotate \(a_{2}\) by one `click', like so:

	\[
		\includegraphics[width=0.26\textwidth, valign=c]{graphics/chord_diagram_connected_sum_result.pdf}
		\quad
		\rightsquigarrow
		\quad
		\includegraphics[width=0.26\textwidth, valign=c]{graphics/chord_diagram_connected_sum_result_rotated.pdf}
	\]
	This is equivalent to sliding a single chord endpoint on the second diagram all the way through the first diagram, along the path of the grey arrow.
	\[
		\includegraphics[width=0.27\textwidth, valign=c]{graphics/chord_diagram_connected_sum_result_with_arrow.pdf}
	\]
	Which we show can be achieved by a series of \ref{eq:4T} relations.

	We can rewrite \ref{eq:4T} as
	\[
		\left(
		\ftnorth
		\ - \
		\ftsouth
		\right)
		\ + \
		\left(
		\fteast
		\ - \
		\ftwest
		\right)
		\ = \ 0.
	\]
	A sliding move of our special chosen endpoint of \(a_{2}\) over an endpoint of some chord of \(a_{1}\) is achieved by subtracting the first two terms of the rearranged \ref{eq:4T}. But every chord of \(a_{1}\) is encountered twice in the path. In the other instance it is encountered, the sliding is achieved by subtracting the remaining two terms of \ref{eq:4T}. So, the two connected sums \(a_{1} \connect a_{2}\) differ by a sum of \ref{eq:4T} relations, completing the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
	The connected sum operation makes \(\mathcal{A}\) into a graded algebra.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	No chords are lost during the connected sum: the \ref{eq:4T} relation is homogenous with respect to degree, so the connected sum of a chord diagram of order \(i\) and a chord diagram of order \(j\) is a chord diagram of order \(i + j\).
\end{proof}

Just as there is a connected sum operation in \(\mathcal{A}\) reminiscent to that in \(\mathcal{K}\), there is a coproduct too.

\begin{definition}
	\label{def:coproduct-in-chord-diagrams}
	The \textbf{coproduct of a chord diagram} \(A\) is the sum of ways of partitioning its chords between two subdiagrams.  
    Specifically, if \(S\) is the set of chords of \(A\), and \(J \subset S\), let \(\widehat{J} = S \smallsetminus J\). Denote by \(A_{J}\) the chord diagram \(A\) but with only the chords in \(J \subset S\), and the rest deleted. Then
	\[\Delta(A) = \sum_{J \subset S} A_{J} \otimes A_{\overline{J}}.\]
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
	The coproduct \(\Delta\) is well-defined in \(\mathcal{A}\), and makes \(\mathcal{A}\) into a graded bialgebra.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	We need to check: that the coproduct factors through the quoitents, that the coproduct respects the grading, and that the coproduct is an algebra morphism (one way of writing the compatibility condition).

	That in the unframed case, \(\Delta\) factors through \ref{eq:1T} is easy: an isolated chord in \(A\) remains isolated and appears in one cofactor of every term of \(\Delta(A)\).

	Also, \(\Delta\) factors through \ref{eq:4T}. Suppose that \(K = A_{1} - A_{2} + A_{3} - A_{4}\) is some combination of chord diagrams to be killed by \ref{eq:4T}. This means that \(K\) looks like
	\[
		K =
		\left(
		\ftnorth
		\ - \
		\ftsouth
		\right)
		\ + \
		\left(
		\fteast
		\ - \
		\ftwest
		\right)
	\]
	where there may be other chords \(O\) that the above diagrams have in common, as well as those shown. Note that there is one moving chord in the above diagram and one stationary chord. Let us label these \(m\) and \(s\). Take the same partition \(J \sqcup \overline{J}\) of \(S\) for all of the four chord diagrams at once, and write as the resulting coproduct \(\Delta(A_{i}) = C_{i} \otimes D_{i}\). Suppose without loss of generality that \(m\) was partitioned into the \(C_{i}\)'s. Then \(D_{1} = D_{2} = D_{3} = D_{4}\), so this term of the coproduct factors as \((C_{1} - C_{2} + C_{3} - C_{4}) \otimes D_{1}\) and either:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \(s\) was also partitioned into the \(C_{i}\)'s, and the relation remains a \ref{eq:4T}, or
		\item \(s\) was partitioned into the \(D_{i}\)'s, and so \(C_{1} = C_{2}\) and \(C_{3} = C_{4}\),
	\end{itemize}
	and in either case, that term of the coproduct is killed.

	The coproduct clearly satisfies
	\[\Delta(\mathcal{A}_{m}) \subset \bigoplus_{i + j = m} \mathcal{A}_{i} \otimes \mathcal{A}_{j} = (\mathcal{A} \otimes \mathcal{A})_{m},\]
	so it is graded.

	The compatibility condition holds. If \(A\) has chord set \(S\) and \(B\) has chord set \(T\), then
	\begin{align*}
		\Delta(A) \connect^{\otimes 2} \Delta(B)
		& = \left(\sum_{J' \subset S} A_{J'} \otimes A_{\overline{J'}} \right) \connect^{\otimes 2} \left(\sum_{J'' \subset T} B_{J''} \otimes B_{\overline{J''}} \right) \\
		& = \sum_{J \subset S \sqcup T} (A \connect B)_{J} \otimes (A \connect B)_{\overline{J}} \\
		& = \Delta(A \connect B).
	\end{align*}
\end{proof}

We have shown that \(\mathcal{A}\) is a graded bialgebra of finite type. In fact \(\mathcal{A}\) is an even more specific structure.

\begin{definition}
	A \textbf{connected, commutative, cocommutative} graded bialgebra of finite type is a graded bialgebra, \(A\), of finite type for which
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The unit map \(\mathcal{Q} \to A_{0}\) is an isomorphism (\textbf{connectedness})
		\item The product is commutative, \(m \circ \tau = m\)
		\item The coproduct is cocommutative, \(\tau \circ \Delta = \Delta\)
	\end{itemize}
	where \(\tau : A \otimes A \to A \otimes A\) sends \(x \otimes y \mapsto y \otimes x\).
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
	The bialgebra \(\mathcal{A}\) is a connected, commutative, cocommutative graded bialgebra of finite type.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	The connetedness isomorphism is given by associating a scalar \(k\) to \(k\) times the empty chord diagram.

	We have already shown the connected sum to be commutative, and the coproduct can clearly be seen to be cocommutative from the symmetry of Definition \ref{def:coproduct-in-chord-diagrams}.
\end{proof}

Connected, commutative, cocommutative graded bialgebras of finite type are very rigid structures. In-particular, a classical strucutral theorem applies, and such a bialgebra can be understood in terms of its primitive elements.

\begin{definition}
	An element \(x\) is \textbf{primitive} in a coalgebra (so in-particular in a bialgebra) with coproduct \(\Delta\) if it satisfies
	\[\Delta(x) = 1 \otimes x + x \otimes 1.\]
	The set of primitive elements of a bialgebra \(A\) is denoted \(\mathcal{P}(A)\), and if \(A\) is graded, then let \(\mathcal{P}_{n}(A)\) denote the set of primitive elements of degree \(n\).
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Milnor-Moore]
	Let \(H\) be a connected, commutative, cocommutative bialgebra of finite type, over a field of characteristic zero. Then, as an algebra, \(H\) is isomorphic to the symmetric algebra of \(\mathcal{P}(H)\). In other words, \(H\) is a polynomial algebra in \(\mathcal{P}(H)\).
\end{theorem}

We refer to \cite{invariants-of-links-and-3-manifolds-from-graph-configurations} or \cite{introduction-to-vassiliev-invariants} for a proof. This fact leads to important consequences about the structure of \(\mathcal{A}\) and its relation to Lie algebras, which will the subject of Chapter \ref{ch:lie-theory-and-jacobi-diagrams}.

\begin{definition}
	The weight systems (Definition \ref{def:weight-system}), denoted \(\mathcal{W}\), form a graded bialgebra, the \textbf{graded bialgebra of weight systems} with grading given by degree \(m\), product given by pointwise multiplication
	\[W_{1}\cdot W_{2}(a) = W_{1}(a)W_{2}(a),\]
	and coproduct, \(\eta\) given by
	\[\eta(W)(a_{1} \otimes a_{2}) = W(a_{1} \connect a_{2}).\]

\end{definition}

In fact, every graded object is a filtered object with the naturally induced filtration. Considering a graded object as such allows us to take its dual filtered bialgebra (which we refer to as its dual graded bialgebra in this case).

\begin{proposition}
	The graded bialgebra \(\mathcal{W}\) is the dual graded bialgebra of the graded bialgebra \(\mathcal{A}\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	That \(\mathcal{W} = \mathcal{A}^{\ast}\) as sets follows from Definition \ref{def:weight-system}. A weight system is a functionals on chord diagrams that is integrable. So a functional satisfying \ref{eq:4Tstar} and \ref{eq:1Tstar}. That is exactly an element of \(\mathcal{A}^{\ast}\). The rest of the proof uses the same arguments as Proposition \ref{prop:vassiliev-invariants-dual-to-singular-knots}.
\end{proof}

\section{The fundamental theorem of Vassiliev invariants}
\label{sec:the-fundamental-theorem-of-vassiliev-invariants}

In Section \ref{sec:the-stratification-on-the-space-of-knots-and-integration}, we gave the fundamental theorem of Vassiliev invariants. The point of this theorem is that is establishes a particular relationship between the algebras of the previous two chapters, \(\mathcal{K}\) and \(\mathcal{A}\) (or equivalently, between \(\mathcal{W}\) and \(\mathcal{V}\)). But admittedly, in the form of Theorem \ref{thm:fundamental-theorem-of-vassiliev-invariants}, it's not a-priori obvious why this is the case. Here we give a restatement of that theorem that makes the relationship explicit.

\begin{definition}
	The \textbf{associated graded} bialgebra of a filtered bialgebra \(A\) is the bialgebra formed by the direct sum of the succesive quotients of the filtered components of \(A\). For a bialgebra with a descending filtration,
	\[\gr A = \bigoplus_{m = 0}^{\infty} A_{m} / A_{m + 1},\]
	and for a bialgebra with an ascending filtration,
	\[\gr A = \bigoplus_{m = 0}^{\infty} A_{m} / A_{m - 1},\]
	where \(A_{-1} = \{0\}\).

	The operations on \(\gr A\) are those induced from the operations on \(A\). For example, on a bialgebra with a descending filtration, if multiplication \(\mu: A_{m} \otimes A_{n} \to A_{m + n}\) sends \(a \otimes b \mapsto ab\), then the induced operation is
	\[
		\begin{array}{rccc}
			\gr \mu:	&A_{m}/A_{m + 1} \otimes A_{n}/A_{n + 1}	&\longrightarrow	& A_{m + n}/A_{m + n + 1}\\
					& a + A_{m + 1} \otimes b + A_{n + 1}		&\longmapsto		& ab + A_{m + n + 1}.
		\end{array}
	\]
	For the comultiplication \(\Delta\) that sends \(a \mapsto \displaystyle\bigoplus_{i + j = m} a_{i}' \otimes a_{i}'' \) the induced operation is
	\[
		\begin{array}{rccc}
			\gr \Delta:	&A_{m}/A_{m + 1}	&\longrightarrow	& \displaystyle\bigoplus_{i + j = m} A_{i}/A_{i + 1} \otimes A_{j}/A_{j + 1}\\
					& a + A_{m + 1}		&\longmapsto		& \displaystyle\bigoplus_{i + j = m} a_{i}' + A_{i + 1} \otimes a_{i}'' + A_{j + 1}.
		\end{array}
	\]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Fundamental theorem]
	\label{thm:fundamental-theorem-restated}
	The algebra of weight systems is isomorphic to the associated graded algebra of the algebra of Vassiliev invariants, \(\mathcal{W} \cong \gr \mathcal{V}\), or on the level of graded components,
	\[\bigoplus_{m = 0}^{\infty} \mathcal{W}_{m} \cong \bigoplus_{m = 0}^{\infty} \mathcal{V}_{m} / \mathcal{V}_{m - 1}.\]

	Equivalently, this can be stated in the dual setting as follows. The algebra of chord diagrams is isomorphic to the associated graded algebra of the algebra of knots, \(\mathcal{A} \cong \gr \mathcal{K}\), or on the level of graded components,
	\[\bigoplus_{m = 0}^{\infty} \mathcal{A}_{m} \cong \bigoplus_{m = 0}^{\infty} \mathcal{K}_{m} / \mathcal{K}_{m + 1}.\]
\end{theorem}

The equivalence of this version of the theorem with the version (Theorem \ref{thm:fundamental-theorem-of-vassiliev-invariants}) given in Section \ref{sec:the-stratification-on-the-space-of-knots-and-integration} will be proven at the end of this section.

We can break the fundamental theorem up into two parts.

	\end{tblr}
\end{center}

The point of the part of this theorem due to Vassiliev \cite{cohomology-of-knot-spaces, complements-of-discriminants-of-smooth-maps-topology-and-applications} is that the relations in \(\mathcal{A}\) are compatible with the relations of \(\mathcal{K}_{n} / \mathcal{K}_{n + 1}\). Indeed, \(\mathcal{A}\) was constructed in this way, and much of that work was already done in Section \ref{sec:the-stratification-on-the-space-of-knots-and-integration}, and the following proof involves nothing new.

\begin{proofof}{Theorem \ref{thm:fundamental-theorem-restated} (Vassiliev)}
	The aim is to define a map \(\mathcal{A}_{m} \to \mathcal{K}_{m} / \mathcal{K}_{m + 1}\). Let us start with a map \(\mathcal{D}_{m} \to \mathcal{K}_{m} / \mathcal{K}_{m + 1}\).
	Given \(d \in \mathcal{D}_{m}\), take a singular knot \(k^{\bullet} \in \singularknots_{m}\) whose chord diagram is \(d\). Then, \(d\) is sent to \([\partial^{m}(k^{\bullet})] \in \mathcal{K}_{m} / \mathcal{K}_{m + 1}\).

	This is well-defined: any other \({\ell^{\bullet}}\) with chord diagram \(d\) also resolves to \([\partial^{m}(k^{\bullet})]\). Indeed, any two \(m\)-singular knots with the same chord diagram differ by some crossing changes. But if \(k^{\bullet}\) and \({\ell^{\bullet}}\) differ by a crossing change, then \(\partial^{m}(k^{\bullet})\) and \(\partial^{m}({\ell^{\bullet}})\) differ by an element of \(\mathcal{K}_{m + 1}\), so \([\partial^{m}(k^{\bullet})] = [\partial^{m}({\ell^{\bullet}})]\) in the quotient. This argument that any \(k^{\bullet} \in \singularknots_{m}\) can be chosen to represent \([\partial^{m}(k^{\bullet})]\) as long as it has chord diagram \(d\) will be used again below, and we refer to it as the crossing-change argument.

	Recalling that \(\mathcal{A}_{m} = \mathcal{D}_{m} / \ref{eq:4T}\) (and \(\mathcal{A}'_{m} = \mathcal{D}_{m} / \ref{eq:1T}, \ref{eq:4T}\)), we need to show that the map factors through the quotient. Indeed in the unframed case, \ref{eq:1T} is in the kernel: a type \ref{eq:1T} chord diagram is sent to a singular knot with a singular point that is passed through twice in a row when the knot is traversed. The resolution of that singular point, by the crossing-change argument, can be chosen to be a difference of two \((m - 1)\)-singular unframed knots that are singular isotopic:
	
	\begin{align*}
		\delta \left(
		\includegraphics[width=0.255\textwidth, valign=c]{graphics/one_term_isotopy_singularity.pdf}
		\right)
		\,
		& =
		\,
		\includegraphics[width=0.255\textwidth, valign=c]{graphics/one_term_isotopy_positive.pdf}
		\,
		-
		\,
		\includegraphics[width=0.255\textwidth, valign=c]{graphics/one_term_isotopy_negative.pdf} \\ 
		& = \, 0.
	\end{align*}

	Similarly, \ref{eq:4T} is also in the kernel. A combination of chord diagrams appearing in a \ref{eq:4T} relation is sent to a combination of singular knots which by the crossing-change argument can all be chosen to be identical except near a small region, where
	\[
		\tftsouth \ - \ \tfteast \ - \ \tftnorth \ + \ \tftwest.
	\]
	Resolving around these four terms about the singular point that they don't have in common yields eight terms which cancel out in pairs.

	The isomorphism respects the algebra structure as \(a_{1} \connect a_{2}\) is sent to \([k_{a_{1} \connect a_{2}}] \in \mathcal{K}_{m + n} / \mathcal{K}_{m + n + 1}\) that comes from the resolution of some singular knot we shall denote \(k^{\bullet}_{a_{1} \connect a_{2}}\) with chord diagram \(a_{1} \connect a_{2}\). But likewise \(a_{1}\) and \(a_{2}\) map to \([k_{a_{1}}]\) and \([k_{a_{2}}]\) which are resolutions of singular knots \(k^{\bullet}_{a_{1}}\) and \(k^{\bullet}_{a_{2}}\). The induced operation from the connect sum \(\mathcal{K}_{m}/\mathcal{K}_{m + 1} \otimes \mathcal{K}_{n}/\mathcal{K}_{n + 1} \to \mathcal{K}_{m + n}/\mathcal{K}_{m + n + 1}\) takes these to \([k_{a_{1}} \connect k_{a_{2}}]\), which comes from the resolution of \(k^{\bullet}_{a_{1}} \connect k^{\bullet}_{a_{2}}\). These singular knots may not a-priori be the same, but they have the same chord diagram, so by the crossing-change argument they can be chosen to be the same. Hence resolving then projecting into \(\mathcal{K}_{m + n} / \mathcal{K}_{m + n + 1}\) gives the same equivalence class.

	Using similar arguments, from the formula of Willerton's Lemma, the isomorphism can be shown to respect the bialgebra structure.

	The dual version of the statement follows from the regular version. We also give a more illustrative direct proof of the dual theorem later.
\end{proofof}

For now, let's turn to the other part of the fundamental theorem, due to Maxim Kontsevich which is much more involved. In \cite{vassilievs-knot-invariants}, Konsevich constructed an integral invariant which proves the fundamental theorem, as well as containing the information of all Vassiliev invariants at the same time. We will not give a detailed exposition of Kontsevich's invariant here, but they abound in the literature, for example \cite{the-fundamental-theorem-of-vassiliev-invariants, the-kontsevich-integral, introduction-to-vassiliev-invariants} in order of increasing level of detail. Rather we will boil the Kontsevich integral down to a single universal property.

\begin{definition}
	The \textbf{completion} of a descending-filtered algebra \(A\) is the descending-filtered algebra
	\[\widehat{A} = \varprojlim_{m \to \infty} A / A_{m + 1}.\]
	This is the inverse system
	% https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsNCxbMCwwLCIwID0gQS9BX3swfSJdLFsxLDAsIkEvQV97MX0iXSxbMiwwLCJBL0FfezJ9Il0sWzMsMCwiXFxjZG90cyJdLFsxLDAsIiIsMCx7InN0eWxlIjp7ImhlYWQiOnsibmFtZSI6ImVwaSJ9fX1dLFsyLDEsIiIsMCx7InN0eWxlIjp7ImhlYWQiOnsibmFtZSI6ImVwaSJ9fX1dLFszLDIsIiIsMCx7InN0eWxlIjp7ImhlYWQiOnsibmFtZSI6ImVwaSJ9fX1dXQ==
	\[\begin{tikzcd}
		{0 = A/A_{0}} & {A/A_{1}} & {A/A_{2}} & \cdots
		\arrow[two heads, from=1-2, to=1-1]
		\arrow[two heads, from=1-3, to=1-2]
		\arrow[two heads, from=1-4, to=1-3]
	\end{tikzcd}\]
	whose \(m\)th filtered component is the set of sequences that vanish in \(A/A_{m + 1}\) (and by the properties of inverse systems, all terms thereafter).
\end{definition}

If \(A\) is graded, then it is also filtered with the natural descending filtration
\[\bigoplus_{i = 0}^{\infty} A_{i} \supseteq \bigoplus_{i = 1}^{\infty} A_{i} \supseteq \cdots.\]
The degree completion of a graded algebra \(A\) if a descending-filtered algebra that coincides with the completion \(\widehat{A}\) taken with respect to the natural descending filtration on \(A\).

\begin{definition}
	A \textbf{universal Vassiliev invariant} is a knot invariant \(Z : \mathcal{K} \to \widehat{\mathcal{A}}\) with the following property. If \(k \in \mathcal{K}_{m}\) is a linear combination of knots with \(k = \partial^{m}(k^{\bullet})\) and \(k^{\bullet}\) has chord diagram \(a \in \mathcal{A}_{m}\), then
	\[Z(k) = a + \text{higher degree terms.}\]

	Phrased in terms of \(\sigma\) and \(\partial\) this reads
	\[Z(\partial^{m}(k^{\bullet})) = \sigma(k^{\bullet}) + \text{higher degree terms.}\]
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
	Another equivalent way of defining a universal Vassiliev invariant is as follows. If \(f\) is a descending-filtration-respecting map \(f: A \to B\), then define the associated graded map \(\gr f: \gr A \to \gr B\) that sends \(a_{m} + A_{m + 1} \mapsto f(a_{m}) + B_{m + 1}\). In other words, a graded map coming from the filtered map \(f\) that forgets information about higher degrees. A universal Vassiliev invariant is a map \(Z: \mathcal{K} \to X\) whose associated graded \(\gr Z: \gr \mathcal{K} \to \gr X\) is an isomorphism.

	A universal Vassiliev invariant is such a map with \(X = \widehat{\mathcal{A}}\). In particular, note that \(\gr \widehat{\mathcal{A}} = \mathcal{A}\) (because the direct sum implicit in \(\gr\) means \(a \in \gr \widehat{\mathcal{A}}\) cannot have infinitely many non-zero terms). So since \(Z\) is \(\mathcal{K} \to \widehat{\mathcal{A}}\) and satisfies this property, then \(\gr \mathcal{K} \cong \mathcal{A}\).
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}[Kontsevich Integral]
	\label{thm:kontsevich-integral-is-universal}
	There exists a universal Vassiliev invariant, denoted \(Z(k)\), called the Kontsevich integral.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proofof}{Theorem \ref{thm:fundamental-theorem-restated} (Kontsevich)}
	Take the map \(k \in \mathcal{K}_{m} \to \mathcal{A}_{m}\) coming from killing the higher degree terms in the Kontsevich integral, and taking the lowest order non-zero chord diagram. This factors through the quotient to a map \(\mathcal{K}_{m}/\mathcal{K}_{m + 1} \to \mathcal{A}_{m}\) since by Theorem \ref{thm:kontsevich-integral-is-universal}, any additional \(k' \in \mathcal{K}_{m + 1}\) contributes only higher degree terms, which get killed. It is easy to see that the two maps are inverses.
\end{proofof}

Again, it's worth looking at the proof in the dual setting too.

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lem:kontsevich-integral-then-weight-system-is-vassiliev}
	Post-composing the Kontsevich integral with a weight system of order \(m\),
	\[k \longmapsto W \circ Z(k)\]
	gives a Vassiliev invariant of order \(m\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{warning}
	More precisely, this is the following composition
	\[\mathcal{K} \overset{Z}{\longrightarrow} \widehat{\mathcal{A}} \overset{\pi_{m}}{\longrightarrow} \mathcal{A}_{m} \overset{W}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{Q}\]
	but we will drop the map \(\pi_{m}\) from the notation. This is equivalent to asserting that a weight system of order \(m\) is zero on chord diagrams of order other than \(m\).
\end{warning}

\begin{proof}
	The map \(W \circ Z\) is clearly an invariant, since \(Z\) is an invariant. By the universal property of \(Z\), if \(k \in \mathcal{K}_{m + 1}\), so then \(k = \partial (k^{\bullet})\) for some \(k^{\bullet}\) in \(\mathcal{K}^{\bullet}_{m + 1}\),
	\[Z(k) = \sigma(k^{\bullet}) + \parbox{2.5cm}{\centering terms of \\ order \((m + 2)\)}\]
	\(Z(k)\) is zero in degrees up to and including \(m\), so composing so composing with a weight system of degree \(m\) gives zero. 
\end{proof}

\begin{proofof}{Theorem \ref{thm:fundamental-theorem-restated} (dual)}
	The map defined by Lemma \ref{lem:kontsevich-integral-then-weight-system-is-vassiliev},  \(\mathcal{W}_{m} \to \mathcal{V}_{m}\) is injective, as only the zero weight system gives the zero invariant.

	However, it is not surjective. We show that the map, written as
	\[\mathcal{W}_{m} \overset{Z^{\ast}}{\longrightarrow} \mathcal{V}_{m} / \mathcal{V}_{m - 1} \oplus \mathcal{V}_{m - 1}\]
	forces a choice of Vassiliev invariant of degree \(m - 1\). Being as explicit as possible, let
	\[\Omega(k) =
		\begin{cases}
			(W \circ Z)(k)
			& k \in \mathcal{K}_{m}
			\\
			0
			& k \notin \mathcal{K}_{m}
			\\
		\end{cases},
		\quad \text{and} \quad
	\Theta(k) =
		\begin{cases}
			0
			& k \in \mathcal{K}_{m}
			\\
			(W \circ Z)(k)
			& k \notin \mathcal{K}_{m}
			\\
		\end{cases},
	\]
	then \(W \circ Z = \Omega + \Theta\), where \(\Omega\) recovers the weight system \(W\), when \(k \in \mathcal{K}_{m}\), and \(\Theta\) is some finite type invariant of order \(m - 1\), determined by \(W\).

	In essence, we have found that the cokernel of \(Z^{\ast}\) is \(\mathcal{V}_{m - 1}\), so we get the desired isomorphism \(\mathcal{W}_{m} \cong \mathcal{V}_{m} / \mathcal{V}_{m - 1}\).
	\end{proofof}

	The natural question arises, what was this summand \(\Theta\)? Fixing \(n < m\) and a knot \(k \in \mathcal{K}_{n}\) with chord diagram \(a_{k}\), it has Kontsevich integral
	\[Z(k) = a_{k} + \parbox{2.5cm}{\centering terms of \\ order \((n + 1)\)} + \cdots + \parbox{1.8cm}{\centering terms of \\ order \(m\)} + \cdots.\]
	Applying the projection \(\pi_{m}\), all that remains are some chord diagrams of order \(m\), with coefficients depending on the intricacies of the Kontsevich integral for that particular knot. Composing with the weight system, this is a \(\mathbb{Q}\)-valued Vassiliev invariant of order \(m - 1\) determined by \(W\).


The name `universal Vassiliev invariant' we gave to the Kontsevich integrals and invariants of its kind is indeed justified. Every Vassiliev invariant can be obtained through the Kontsevich integral.

\begin{theorem}
	If \(Z\) is a universal Vassiliev invariant, then every Vassiliev invariant factors through \(Z\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Let \(V \in \mathcal{V}_{m}\). Following the proof above, we can project \(V\) to \(\mathcal{V}_{m} / \mathcal{V}_{m - 1}\) to get a weight system \(W_{m}\). Subtracting \(W_{m} \circ Z\) leaves a Vassiliev invariant of lesser degree. In other words, via the isomorphism
	\begin{align*}
		\mathcal{V}_{m}
		& \cong \mathcal{V}_{m}/\mathcal{V}_{m - 1} \oplus \mathcal{V}_{m - 1} / \mathcal{V}_{m - 2} \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathcal{V}_{1} / \mathcal{V}_{0} \oplus \mathcal{V}_{0}\\
		& \cong \mathcal{W}_{m} \oplus \mathcal{W}_{m - 1} \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathcal{W}_{1} \oplus \mathcal{W}_{0},
	\end{align*}
	\(V\) can be written as a sequence of weight systems of degree from \(1\) to \(m\) such that \(V\) factors through the Kontsevich integral
	\[V = \sum_{i = 0}^{m} (W_{m} \circ Z) = \left(\bigoplus_{i = 0}^{m} W_{m}\right) \circ Z.\]
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
	A universal Vassiliev invariant (in-particular, the Kontsevich integral \(Z\)) is exactly as strong as the set of Vassiliev invariants.
\end{corollary}

\begin{definition}
	Taking the projection \(\mathcal{V}_{m} \to \mathcal{V}_{m}/\mathcal{V}_{m + 1} \cong \mathcal{W}_{m}\) yields a weight system. The \textbf{canonical Vassiliev invariants} are those Vassiliev invariants whose weight systems \(W\) recover them completely via \(W \circ Z\).
\end{definition}

In other words, not all bases of \(\mathcal{V}_{m}\) are created equal. The canonical Vassiliev invariants are those that are homogenous with respect to the splitting of \(\mathcal{V}_{m}\)
\[\mathcal{V}_{m}/\mathcal{V}_{m - 1} \oplus \mathcal{V}_{m - 1} / \mathcal{V}_{m - 2} \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathcal{V}_{1} / \mathcal{V}_{0} \oplus \mathcal{V}_{0}\]
induced by the Kontsevich integral. Canonical Vassiliev invariants were first defined in \cite{on-the-melvin-morton-rozansky-conjecture} and used to prove the Melvin-Morton-Rozansky conjecture relating the coefficients of Alexander polynomial of a knot to those of the coloured Jones polynomials. This is a good example of how the theory of Vassiliev invariants is useful for probing the structure of knots.

\begin{question}[Bar-Natan--Garoufalidis]
	There are a few known from-the-bottom-up constructions of universal Vassiliev invariants of knots. However they are all equivalent to, or conjecturally equivalent to the Kontsevich integral. Yet the Kontsevich integral is not the only invariant that can satisfy the defining degree property of a universal Vassiliev invariant.

	Is there a reason why the Kontsevich integral, or equivalently, this splitting appears to be canonical?
\end{question}

Finally, we return to the equivalence of the two fundamental theorems.

\begin{proof}[Equivalence of Theorems \ref{thm:fundamental-theorem-of-vassiliev-invariants} and \ref{thm:fundamental-theorem-restated}]
	For the forward direction, suppose Theorem \ref{thm:fundamental-theorem-of-vassiliev-invariants} holds. This states that every invariant \(v^{\bullet}\) of \(m\)-singular knots satisfying \ref{eq:T4Tstar} and further that \(\delta v^{\bullet} = 0\), then \(v^{\bullet}\) integrates to an invariant \(v\) of \(0\)-singular knots.

	First we prove that the Kontsevich part of the fundamental theorem holds. Let \(W\) be a weight system of order \(m\). Then \(W\) defines an invariant \(v_{W}^{\bullet}\) of \(m\)-singular knots by \(v_{W}^{\bullet}(k) = W(\sigma(k))\). The derivative of \(v_{W}^{\bullet}\) is zero. Indeed, 
	\[\delta v_{W}^{\bullet}(k) = W(\sigma(k^{+})) - W(\sigma(k^{-}))\]
	for some knots \(k^{+}\) and \(k^{-}\) that differ by crossing changes, but \(\sigma\) is invariant under crossing changes. Also, since \(W\) is a weight system it satisfies \ref{eq:4Tstar}, and so \(W'\) satisfies \ref{eq:T4Tstar}. Therefore the hypotheses of Theorem \ref{thm:fundamental-theorem-of-vassiliev-invariants} hold and integrates into a Vassiliev invariant.

	The Vassiliev part of the theorem is independent of the original version and was proven separately in Section \ref{sec:the-stratification-on-the-space-of-knots-and-integration}.

	Now for the reverse direction, suppose Theorem \ref{thm:fundamental-theorem-restated} holds. Take a \(m\)-singular knot invariant \(v^{\bullet}\) satisfying \ref{eq:4Tstar} and that \(\delta v^{\bullet} = 0\). This defines a weight system \(W_{v^{\bullet}}\), which by the Kontsevich part of Theorem \ref{thm:fundamental-theorem-restated} gives an invariant class in \(\mathcal{V}_{m} / \mathcal{V}_{m - 1}\). Explicitly, this invariant is \(W_{v^{\bullet}} \circ Z\). But by definition of \(\delta\),
		\[
			\delta^{m} (W_{v^{\bullet}} \circ Z)(k^{\bullet})
			=
			(W_{v^{\bullet}} \circ Z)(\partial^{m} k^{\bullet})
		\]
	which by the definition of a universal Vassiliev invariant is just \(v^{\bullet}\).

	Thus, \(W_{v^{\bullet}} \circ Z\) is the \(m\)th derivative of \(v^{\bullet}\), so \(v^{\bullet}\) integrates into a Vassiliev invariant of order \(m\), completing the proof.

	Without loss of generality, the proof works also in the unframed case.
\end{proof}
