\chapter{Lie Theory and Jacobi Diagrams}
\label{ch:lie-theory-and-jacobi-diagrams}

% The following sections are simply a list of topics.

\section{(Rooted) Jacobi Diagrams}

\section{Floating Jacobi Diagrams}

\scaffold{In the next section we construct the suprising isomorphism between these two spaces.}

\section{PBW Theorem}

\scaffold{The Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt theorem for Lie algebras has many forms. One of these is that [...] . A corollary of this theorem \cite{enveloping-algebras} is that there is a `canonical' (though, not natural) isomorphism \(S(\mathfrak{g}) \to \mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{g})\) given by \[\omega(x_{1} \cdots x_{n}) = \frac{1}{n!} \sum_{\sigma \in S_{n}} x_{\sigma(1)} \cdots x_{\sigma(n)}.\] Which simply exhibits that fact that \(\operatorname{gr} A \cong A\) unnaturally.}

\scaffold{Futher, \cite{enveloping-algebras}, the two spaces (though not isomorphic as algebras) are isomorphic as \(\mathfrak{g}\)-modules: \(\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{g})^{\mathfrak{g}} \cong S(\mathfrak{g})^{\mathfrak{g}}\).}

\scaffold{The following theorem is a diagrammatic version of the above.}

\section{Product, Coproduct and Hopf Algebra Structure}

\subsection{Primitive and Grouplike Elements}

\section{Vassiliev Invariants From Lie Algebras with a Metric}
